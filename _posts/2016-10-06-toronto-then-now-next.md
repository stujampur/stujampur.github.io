I am very pleased to be attending and speaking at <a href="http://thetorontoschool.ca/">**The Toronto School: THEN NOW NEXT**</a> conference at the University of Toronto from the 13th-16th of October. This international conference assembles a unique group of Canadian and international interdisciplinary experts on media, communication, and culture - including researchers from humanities and social sciences, artists and leading public thinkers. I'll be talking about Marshall McLuhan and new literary practice in this esteemed company. Here's the abstract:   
<br>
**Resonant Connections: McLuhan and the New Literary Practice**
<br>This paper applies the key concepts of Marshall McLuhan’s co-authored posthumous works, *The Laws of Media* [1988] and *The Global Village* [1989], to new literary practice. Taking David Mitchell’s recent novel and Twitter work, *Slade House* [2015] and @I_Bombadil [2015], as a case study example of new literary practice, it demonstrates the need for a media-based perspective that addresses cross- and multi-media writing and accounts for the specificities of the medium as an inextricable part of the work itself.
<br>The “resonant connections” indicated by this paper’s title therefore operate on two distinct levels. Firstly, in applying McLuhan’s tetrad – his “laws of media” – to David Mitchell’s *Slade House* and @I_Bombadil, the way in which the author makes resonant connections between his works by extending his literary practice and threading it through the functional characteristics and structural biases of a newer medium is illuminated and articulated. Secondly, in applying the key concepts of McLuhan’s co-authored posthumous works to new literary practice, a critical vocabulary can be established that describes new methods and modes of experimental writing yet to be fully formulated in the field.
