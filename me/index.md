I am **Stuart James Purcell**. I am currently a doctoral researcher in **English Literature and Media Theory** in the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/">School of Critical Studies</a> at the University of Glasgow.     
<br>

My research focuses on contemporary literary practice and media theory. My thesis analyses writers working in a cross-media capacity, in both print and digital, specifically in the novel form and on the Twitter platform, from a media theory-based perspective. At the same time, it explores the functional characteristics and structural biases, particularly in terms of temporality, of print and digital media from a literary practice-based perspective.     
<br>

More specifically, I apply Marshall McLuhan’s media studies (primarily those of his posthumous texts, *The Laws of Media* and *The Global Village*) to four contemporary, cross-media literary practitioners (Teju Cole, Jennifer Egan, David Mitchell, and Tao Lin) via case study analysis. I examine the role that the medium plays as a part of their literary productions – their novels and Twitter works – as well as simultaneously illuminating the often unseen functionalities and biases of print and digital media by viewing them through the lens of literary practice.     
<br>

I spent two years teaching on the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=ENGLIT2001">English Literature 2A: Writing and Ideology</a> core course at Glasgow. I am also co-founder of the group for <a href="https://xpmgla.github.io">Experimental Methods in the Humanities at Glasgow (XPMGla)</a>. I also work as a mentor at the University of Strathclyde in the <a href="http://www.strath.ac.uk/sees/wideningaccess/">Widening Access Team</a>, a part of the <a href="http://www.focuswest.org.uk/">Focus West</a> project.
