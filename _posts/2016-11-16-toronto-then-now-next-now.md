<br>
Although it's been a month since the <a href="http://thetorontoschool.ca/">**The Toronto School: THEN NOW NEXT**</a> conference at the University of Toronto, I'm still reflecting on the immense intellectual heritage of The Toronto School and vibrant academic ambience of the conference. Not only were there numerous innovative and insightful approaches to McLuhan that were of particular and personal interest, but the conference and the papers presented also pressed home the uniqueness of circumstances surrounding The Toronto School's coming into (symbolic) existence, as the lives and works of these singular thinkers coincided and collided in Toronto.  
<br>
Some personal highlights include: the unveiling of Rene Cera's 'Pied Pipers All': Nicholas Grodsky, Julia Hildebrand, and Ernest Hakanen's 'Screening the Tetrad – A Tetrad of Screens' (and, in fact, the tetrad arguably being the star theoretical paradigm of the conference - see also: <a href="https://twitter.com/McLuhanTetrad">@McLuhanTetrad</a>): Anthony Enns' 'Canadian and German Media Theory': Adam Pugen's 'Concept Over Percept: The Digital/Tactile Interface as Ground For Unearthing Marshall McLuhan’s Disembodied Idea'; Allen Kempton's 'Playful Expressions: Video Game Mods as Media of Communication'; Rita Watson's 'Mind and Media: New Evidence on a Core Tenet'; Elena Lamberti's 'Outspreading the School of Toronto Original Storytelling'; and Sarah Martel's 'The Incubator (as a Reproductive Technology)'.   
<br>
But, as far as personal highlights go, this was pretty hard to beat:

I am still very humbled, surprised, and (most of all) grateful to have received the Outstanding Paper Award for a postgraduate student at the conference for my paper, 'Resonant Connections: McLuhan and the New Literary Practice', especially given the incredibly high level of work presented by the postgraduates whose papers I saw/heard.   
<br>
My sincere thanks (and props) to all the organisers and committees involved, and the University of Toronto at large: you gave exceptionally good conference. I truly hope - as Paolo Ganata suggested in his preamble - that this is merely the start of a resurgence of application and appreciation of The Toronto School, whose work, if I may refer to the title of my own paper, continues to resonate in the contemporary (techno)cultural context.
